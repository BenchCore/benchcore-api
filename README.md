`benchcore-api` is a library client designed to facilitate how you interact with BenchCore RootChains and SideChains.

## Why TypeScript

  * TypeScript is is a superset of JavaScript which mainly offers optional static typing, classes, and interfaces. The learning curve is not that steep.
  * Types are optional, `benchcore-api` compiles into ES5 so you can work with both, ECMAScript or TypeScript.
  * A better development experience, including auto-complete and fully documented.
